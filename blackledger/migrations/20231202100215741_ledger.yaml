  The ledger is the fundamental tenancy unit of the database. Each ledger is a separate
  chart of accounts -- Each account, transaction, and entry belongs to a single ledger,
  with the intent that there be no cross-ledger transactions (transactions with entries
  in two different ledgers) -- although this is possible at the database level.
