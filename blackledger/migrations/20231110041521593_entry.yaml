  Transaction entries: one per leg. Fields:

  * id = unique primary key entry identifier
  * tx = id of the transaction this entry is a part of
  * acct = id of the account this entry belongs to
  * curr = currency code of this transaction entry
  * dr or cr = the debit or credit amount for this transaction entry:
    * One must be null
    * The other must be greater than zero (NOTE: Is an entry with amt=0 ever needed?)
    * NOTE: We're using decimal for amounts even though they are slower for aggregation
