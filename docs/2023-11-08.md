## BlackLedger
— An accounting ledger API service.

See
* GitHub: [seanharrison/blackledger](https://github.com/seanharrison/blackledger)

Requirements (v1):

* [x] Double-entry accounting.
    - [x] Debits = Credits
    - [ ] Assets + Expenses = Equity + Liabilities + Income (requires knowing account type)
* [x] Decimal (not floating-point) amounts.
* [x] Account versions for optimistic locking / concurrency control.
* [x] Multiple currencies / currency-agnostic. See:
    - <https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html>
    - <https://beancount.github.io/docs/beancount_v3.html#currency-accounts-instead-of-a-single-conversion>
    - => track conversions from one currency to another using equity currency accounts, one per currency
* [x] Immutable transaction entries.
* [x] Effective date and posting date — see [Eventual Business Consistency](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/eventual-business-consistency), which allows for immutable adjustments to historical data. (posting date = date posted to the ledger, effective date = current or past date at which the transaction takes effect).
* [/] Multi-tenancy: each tenant has their own separate chart of accounts and transactions.
    - [/] Each transaction belongs to a single tenant: no cross-tenant transactions.

Later features:

* Cryptographic verifiability of transactions / entries - entry includes hash of previous account entry.
* Cost basis tracking for inventories / investments. See:
    - <https://beancount.github.io/docs/how_inventories_work.html#cost-basis>
    - automatic booking methods: FIFO, LIFO, average cost.
