I want to be able to post a new transaction to my ledger so I can build up a history of transactions.

* When I post a transaction, it has at least two entries and can have multiple entries.
* If one of the entries doesn't have an amount, it is calculated from the others.
* The total of debits + credits = 0 for the transaction.
* All entries of the transaction use the same currency.
