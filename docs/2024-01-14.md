## Optional / Configurable Features

Optional features are those that can be configured at the installation instance level, the ledger level, or the individual account level. These features create a performance hit, so disabling them at the instance level will result in faster transaction insert performance.

- Authentication: Enable owner to ensure that all client users / applications are authenticated to access the ledger.

  - Scope: instance
  - Values (bool): true, false. default = true
    - true: all requests must be authenticated with a signed JWT that is verified as having the correct signature, issuer, audience, and timestamps.
    - false: all requests are allowed without authentication.

- Multi-ledger

  - Scope: instance
  - Values (bool): true, false. default = false
    - true:
      - every account, transaction, and transaction entry must have an explicit ledger. Every transaction entry must have the same ledger as both the transaction and the account.
      - lookup URLs must have a ledger component.
    - false:
      - every account, transaction, and entry is automatically assigned the "root" ledger id (as defined in the instance settings) and no checking is done for tenancy consistency between a transaction and its accounts when posting a transaction.
      - lookup URLs don't have to have a ledger component.

- Optimistic locking enabled / enforced - When enabled for a transaction, each transaction entry must be posted with the currently-stored account_version for that entry's account; if not, the transaction is rejected (HTTP 412 Precondition Failed).

  - Scope: instance, ledger, account
  - Values (enum): enforced, enabled, disabled. default = enabled.
    - enforced: All transactions in the configuration scope must have correct account entry version in each entry.
    - enabled: Transactions in the configuration scope that include account entry versions must have them correct.
    - disabled: Transactions in the configuration scope must not include account entry versions, no queries are done to check for proper values, and no accounts are updated along with posting a transaction.

- Automatic cached balances.

  - Scope: instance, ledger, account
  - Values (bool): true, false. default = false
    - true: account balances are cached during each transaction (along with the entry version).
    - false: account balances are not cached during the transaction; they can be cached later (e.g., after being calculated).

- Event streaming: Enable other services to stay up-to-date with the ledger by streaming all insert / update / delete events.

  - Scope: instance, ledger
  - Values (bool): true, false. default = false
    - true: each insert / update / delete event on accounts and transactions is streamed to the configured event streaming service (publisher) with the configured topic.
    - false: no insert / update / delete event on accounts and transactions are streamed.

- Cryptographic verifiability: Enable client applications to verify that the transaction history has not been changed.

  - Scope: instance, ledger, account
  - Values (bool): true, false. default = false
    - true: each transaction entry is stored with the id and hash of the previous transaction entry.
    - false: no hash or id of the previous transaction entry is stored.

- Access control: Relationship-based access control - Protect endpoints based on the caller's relationship with the objects that it includes.
  - Scope: instance
  - Values (bool): true, false. default = false
  - Entities: users, groups, ledgers, accounts, transactions
  - Permissions: read, create, update, delete
