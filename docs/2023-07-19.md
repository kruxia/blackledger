The Repository (database) needs to be able to handle the following actions:

+ Accounts:
    + insert (Account)
    + search (AccountFilters) -> Iterator[Account]

+ Transactions
    + insert (Transaction)
    + search (TransactionFilters) -> Iterator[Transaction]

For each action, it needs to know how to map input to one or more queries that need to be performed on the database.
